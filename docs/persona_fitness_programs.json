      "assessment": "**Current Status & Goals**\nJordan is a 38-year-old marketing manager and parent looking to improve overall health while managing occasional lower back tightness from sitting and lifting children. With a current activity level of 1-2 days per week and fair physical function, he's ready to commit to 3 days per week of 25-minute morning sessions, prioritizing health improvement and energy restoration.\n\n**Key Considerations**\nThe lower back tightness requires attention to proper form and gradual progression. Jordan's confidence level (6/10) suggests he may benefit from structured guidance and early wins to build momentum. His time constraints as a working parent make efficient, home-based workouts essential.\n\n**Focus Areas for Next 4-6 Weeks**\n1. Core strengthening and posterior chain activation to support back health\n2. Mobility work targeting hip flexors and thoracic spine\n3. Building consistent habits with achievable morning routines\n\n**Actionable Next Steps**\n1. Start with 15-minute bodyweight circuits focusing on glute activation and core stability\n2. Incorporate daily movement breaks (2-3 minutes) during work hours\n3. Add gentle stretching sessions before bedtime to address back tightness\nSurvey Context:\n- Primary Goal: Improve health\n- Current Pain: Occasional lower back tightness from sitting and lifting kids\n- Activity Frequency: 1-2 days per week\n- Physical Function: Fair\n- Time Commitment: 3 days/week, 25 minutes, Morning\n- Equipment: Bodyweight only, Outdoor space\n- Activity Preferences: Home workouts, Walking/hiking",

With good physical function and current activity at 3-4 days/week, she's ready to commit to 5 morning sessions per week while managing mild knee discomfort from cycling.\n\n**Key Considerations**\nThe knee discomfort requires careful exercise selection and proper warm-up protocols. Samira's high confidence (8/10) and importance rating (9/10) suggest strong motivation, but her history of burnout indicates the need for balanced programming that prevents overtraining.\n\n**Focus Areas for Next 4-6 Weeks**\n1. Gradual strength rebuilding with knee-friendly exercises\n2. Balancing cycling with complementary strength and flexibility work\n3. Implementing recovery strategies to prevent overuse injuries\n\n**Actionable Next Steps**\n1. Alternate between strength training and yoga/stretching sessions\n2. Incorporate knee strengthening exercises and proper warm-up routines\n3. Monitor knee discomfort and adjust intensity as needed\nSurvey Context:\n- Primary Goal: Gain strength\n- Current Pain: Mild knee discomfort from long cycling sessions\n- Activity Frequency: 3-4 days per week\n- Physical Function: Good\n- Time Commitment: 5 days/week, 60 minutes, Morning\n- Equipment: Gym with machines/weights, Cardio equipment\n- Activity Preferences: Cycling, Strength training, Yoga/stretching",

      "assessment": "**Current Status & Goals**\nCarlos is a 45-year-old remote customer support specialist dealing with chronic neck and shoulder stiffness from prolonged desk work. Currently inactive with poor physical function, his primary goal is pain reduction through gentle movement. With medical clearance and high importance (10/10) but low confidence (4/10), he needs a safe, gradual approach.\n\n**Key Considerations**\nThe chronic neck and shoulder issues require careful exercise selection and gradual progression. Carlos's low confidence suggests the need for clear guidance and early success experiences. Short afternoon sessions (15 minutes, 4x/week) align with his work schedule and pain management goals.\n\n**Focus Areas for Next 4-6 Weeks**\n1. Gentle mobility work for neck and shoulder relief\n2. Building movement confidence through safe, achievable exercises\n3. Establishing consistent daily movement habits\n\n**Actionable Next Steps**\n1. Begin with 10-minute gentle stretching routines targeting neck and shoulders\n2. Incorporate posture-improving exercises that can be done at a desk\n3. Gradually increase duration as comfort and confidence improve\nSurvey Context:\n- Primary Goal: Reduce pain\n- Current Pain: Chronic neck and shoulder stiffness from desk posture\n- Activity Frequency: 0 days per week\n- Physical Function: Poor\n- Time Commitment: 4 days/week, 15 minutes, Afternoon\n- Equipment: Bodyweight only\n- Activity Preferences: Yoga/stretching, Home workouts",
